\description{
Generate your own custom parameterized models for predicting hatching and emergence phenology
}
\details{
\code{hatchR} also includes functionality to generate your own custom
parameterized models for predicting hatching and emergence phenology.
Importantly, the custom parameterization relies on the model format
developed from model 2 of Beacham and Murray (1990), which we chose
because of its overall simplicity and negligible loss of accuracy.
See Beacham and Murray (1990) and Sparks et al. (2019) for more
specific discussion regarding model 2 and the development of the
effective value approach.
