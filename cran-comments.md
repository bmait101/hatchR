## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* omitted "+ file LICENSE" from DESCRIPTION and the file itself
* ommited the email address from README

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* added a missing dependency on R >= 4.1.0 because package code uses the pipe syntax added in R 4.1.0

Additionally, the incoming checks automatically noted:

* possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  al (13:128)
  et (13:125)
  phenological (13:216)
  
  et, al, and phenological are valid

* the following (possibly) invalid file URIs:
  URI: morgan.sparks@usda.gov
  URI: bryan.maitland@usda.gov
  
  Both of these are valid email addresses

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new submission.
