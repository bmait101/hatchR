## Overview

**IN DEVELOPMENT**

hatchR is a tool that allow users to leverage daily temperature records
to predict when a fish is expected to hatch and/or emerge using
statistical models.

Specifically, hatchR is intended to bridge the analytic gap of taking
statistical models developed in hatchery settings (e.g., Beacham and
Murray 1990) and applying them to real world temperature data sets using
the effective value framework developed by Sparks et al.Â (2019).

## Installation

[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
