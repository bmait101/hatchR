## Overview

**IN DEVELOPMENT**

`hatchR` is an R package for predicting fish developmental phenology
using statistical models. It is intended to bridge the analytic gap of
taking statistical models developed in hatchery settings (e.g., Beacham
and Murray 1990) and applying them to real world temperature data sets
using the effective value framework developed by Sparks et al. (2019).

## Installation

You can install the development version of hatchR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bmait101/hatchR")
```
