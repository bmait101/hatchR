	abstract = {We examined rate of development to alevin hatching and fry emergence, embryo and alevin survival, and alevin and fry size for five Pacific salmon species. There was little difference among values for hatching and emergence time predicted by a modified thermal sums model, power law model (log-inverse Belehrádek), or quadratic model. Coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch had the fastest rates of development to hatching and emergence of the five species investigated; rankings for the other species depended upon temperature range. Coho salmon embryos had the highest survival rates at low incubation (1.5°C) temperatures. Embryos of pink salmon O. gorbuscha had the lowest survival at temperatures less than 4°C. For all five species, incubation temperature was the more important factor in determining alevin length, and egg size was the more important factor in determining alevin weight. Egg weight was a major determinant of fry weight at emergence. Rates of development to hatching and emergence, and alevin and fry size, differed by species in response to changes in temperature, Coho salmon alevins and fry were proportionately larger at 4°C than at 8°C or 12°C, but alevins and fry of pink salmon and chum salmon O. keta were largest at 8°C. Variation in development characters of Pacific salmon reflected adaptations to each species' life history pattern.},

	abstract = {Climate warming poses challenges to native fish, particularly at high latitudes. We used incubation models to explore how interactions between spawning timing and daily varying water temperature affected emergence timing for five species of Pacific salmon in 33 thermally diverse streams in south-central Alaska. Interactions between spawning timing and stream thermal regime led to three different emergence timing responses: (1) “expanded” by typically 2–3 times the duration of the spawning window for summer spawning salmon at streams with a large annual water temperature range; (2) “equal” in duration to the spawning window, regardless of spawning timing, at streams with upwelling groundwater; and (3) “compressed” for late-spawning salmon where water temperature was cooler at spawning than at emergence. Across all sites, a ±15-day range in spawning timing had influence similar to anomalously warm winters (+2 °C to +3 °C) on the emergence timing window. Differences among species, spawning timing, and thermal regimes suggest that a range of adaptations in spawning behavior will likely enable Pacific salmon populations to accommodate shifting thermal regimes during their early life history.},
